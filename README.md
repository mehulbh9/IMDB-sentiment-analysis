# Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews

This project aims to design and implement a classifier that can accurately determine the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative. Using the IMDB dataset, which contains 50,000 reviews from the Internet Movie Database, this classifier will process text data to predict sentiment labels.

## Project Description

The classifier takes a movie review as input and outputs a sentiment label ('positive' or 'negative'). For example, a review expressing satisfaction with a movie's plot and the emotional impact of its story would be labeled as 'positive'.
